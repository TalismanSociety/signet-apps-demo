# Signet Apps Demo

Build great multisig experience with [Signet](https://talisman.xyz/signet)

## What is this?

This is a demo app to demonstrate how great multisig and EOA experience can co-exist on Signet. By integrating with the [Signet SDK](https://github.com/TalismanSociety/signet-apps-sdk), you can inject multisig wallets on Signet (aka Signet Vaults) into your dapp, and allow Signet Vaults to sign transactions crafted from your dapp.

## Getting started

1. Install dependencies

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm nstall
# or
bun install
```

2. run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.
